[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for Cumulocity frontend development.

### Why?
As usual, it all started with laziness. Laziness in repeating the same thing over and over again. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Then with bits of creativity and big interest in automation, comes this hobby project. :speedboat:

## Installation
* Make sure you have Node.js â‰¥ v6.10.0 installed and npm from its [website](https://nodejs.org), or better even, use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

* Install Yeoman, he's a cool guy. :-) Get to know more about him here: http://yeoman.io/.

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
```

* Install the generator:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-c8y
```

## Usage
Available generators:

* c8y:module
* c8y:service
* c8y:provider
* c8y:component
* c8y:directive
* c8y:filter
* c8y:decorator

For instance, to generate a service and its unit test:

```bash
$ yo c8y:service
```

## TODO
I and my colleague, Jan Feuerbach, are working on another interesting generator to speed up our process of scaffolding custom widgets and plugins in the PoC team at Cumulocity.

- [x] c8y:plugin
- [x] c8y:plugin widget
- [ ] c8y:plugin chart
- [x] c8y:plugin translations

## Caveats
* This generator is still on the experimental stage.
* Code generated by the generator assumes Angular 1.5+ is used.
* Generator for controller is not provided **on purpose** because its usage is considered sucks these days (well, the more honest reason would be: I'm just lazy to do it). *Glue your controller to your component instead!* ;-)
